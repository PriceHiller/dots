* Neovim Configuration
This is my Neovim configuration. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

I make no promises things in here are the most well thought out configuration nor capable of
working outside of the narrow scope I set up my systems in.

I am sure /much/ of it will work on any computer with a bash or zsh shell, but I don't want to
invest the effort at the time of writing to find out and make it work across a bunch of use cases.


* TODO Neogit
- [ ] Determine why Neogit's diff hunks are not highlighted until I palce a cursor over a hunk.
  - Right now the diffs have 0 highlighting which makes it annoying to just glance at them â€”
    requires manual movement of the cursor position ðŸ«¤

* TODO CI Automation
- [ ] Configure a pipeline to enforce formatting via stylua
