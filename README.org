* Price Hiller's Dots
This is a mirror from my Git server over [[https://git.price-hiller.com/Price/dots][here]].

These are my dot files. All the actual dots can be found under ~users/price/dots/~.

I've gone pretty far to break things up and make my dots as easy as possible to install for a
new system.

In the past I was running on a Mac, so you may find some Mac specific things (especially in my
~zsh~) config.

For the record, feel free to take what you want. I'm not worried about getting contribution for
dot files. They're largely just for fun, not something important. ðŸ™‚
