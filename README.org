* Price Hiller's Dots
This is a mirror from my Git server over [[https://git.orion-technologies.io/Price/dots][here]].

These are my dot files. All the actual dots can be found under ~dots/~.

I've gone pretty far to break things up and make my dots as easy as possible to install for a
new system. Currently I'm rolling non-NixOS Linux, so some things are a bit /weird/. I set up my
system using _Ansible_ over [[https://git.orion-technologies.io/Ansible/Dot_Files][here]].

In the future I intend to move my personal computer to NixOS. In the past I was running on a Mac,
so you may find some Mac specific things (especially in my ~zsh~) config.

For the record, feel free to take what you want. I'm not worried about getting contribution for
dot files. They're largely just for fun, not something important. ðŸ™‚

* Using the Dots from Nix

I have included a ~install.bash~ script at the top level of this repository. I did this because I
don't like storing my ~home-manager~ config under ~$HOME/.config/home-manager~ and prefer to keep
it under ~$HOME/.dot_files~.

As such, the ~install.bash~ script wraps up the logic for running the flake outside of the default
path ~home-manager~ expects.

* TODO Various Tasks to get done [1/2]

- [ ] Clean up and better modularize the config
  - Currently a large portion of this config lives in ~config/default.nix~ which, while ok for
    now, will get out of hand down the road
- [X] Implement automation to autoformat various paths
  - Looking through the commit history I have semi-regular ~style~ commits for formatting.
  - Would be good to add a global git hook on the client side for pre push validation
  - Would also be good to get a CI runner up that validates on the server side
